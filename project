A small local server that tells you things about your codebase as they happen.

 [5] [Planning] I have prototyped the broad strokes using Python.
 [3] [Planning] I know what the "status" of a Git repository is.
 [8] [UI] I have investigated the macOS API available to create a small window at the bottom right.
 [3] [Build] I have integrated [forge].
